                <p>
                    The Makati City Library was originally named the Makati Public Library which was 
                    established by Resolution No. 22 and Ordinance No. 9 of the Special Meeting of the 
                    Municipal Council of Makati, Rizal, held on January 28, 1954. It was organized in 
                    1954 by the Makati Women's League, whose advisers were the late Mrs. Dolores M. 
                    Rivera (ex-councilor) and late Mrs. Mercedes Samson.<br><br> The Library was turned over 
                    to the Municipal Government shortly after its opening. Miss Veronidia Gutierrez 
                    Garcia (now Mrs. Veronidia Garcia Garcia) was then appointed as library custodian. 
                    The library was located in a small room at the back of the Makati Fire Department. 
                    It had sparse furniture consisting of a long plywood table, two long benches, an 
                    office table for the librarian, and bookshelves enough to contain the 300 volumes of 
                    books that the library acquired as initial stock from the Bureau of Public Libraries, 
                    now the National Library of the Philippines. Another 500 volumes of books were later 
                    acquired from the defunct House of Representatives at the instance of Mrs. Dolores M. 
                    Rivera. Some civic-spirited citizens subscribed to two newspapers for the library. An 
                    average of 100 persons used to come daily to the library despite the scarcity of 
                    reading materials, most of them students and out-of-school youths. As the years passed,
                     some changes in the library took place. But these were mostly insignificant because, 
                     with the election of a new Mayor, new personnel managed the library, and its location 
                     was also changed.<br><br> In 1963, the library was moved to the 4th floor of the new 
                     municipal building during the term of the late Mayor Maximo Estrella. The mayor 
                     launched a program upgrading all departments of the municipal government and the 
                     library began an important phase of development with the purchasing of facilities 
                     including the purchase of new books. When typhoon Yoling partially destroyed the 
                     building in 1967, the library was moved to the 2nd floor of the old municipal 
                     building. The place was spacious enabling the library personnel to put up the 
                     various sections. It was also then, that the library expanded with two branches in 
                     Barrio Bangkal and Barrio Comembo. The library and its two branches had at one time 
                     earned the distinction of being the Most Outstanding Library in the Philippines 
                     under the leadership of the Municipal Librarian, Mrs. Veronidia Garcia Garcia.<br><br>
                     When the late Nemesio I. Yabut assumed office in 1972, one of his first moves was 
                     the relocation of the library to the second floor of the Eassale Building at J. P. 
                     Rizal Avenue corner Makati Avenue.<br><br> In 1975, the library was able to have a 
                     Bookmobile library donated by the USAID. This Bookmobile was the first of its kind 
                     in Metro Manila. It was able to serve different schools and some far barrios of 
                     Makati. In the latter part of 1981, the bookmobile unit had mechanical trouble that 
                     caused it to stop operations. In time for the 1984 - 1985 school year, the Ayala 
                     Corporation on the occasion of its 150th Anniversary donated 749 books on different 
                     subjects and different school levels. The Ayala Corporation also paid for the repair 
                     of the office equipment.<br><br> The library established and opened up five barangay 
                     libraries and five rolling micro libraries all over Makati. However, the latter were 
                     operational for one year only.<br><br>

                        <br>But neither the founders of this public library were discouraged by the odds; 
                        lack of financial support, lack of books, the seemingly wait-and-see attitude of 
                        the public and the municipal government. These insurmountable obstacles proved to 
                        be the catalyst that further motivated the founders to ignore the hindrances and 
                        keep moving forward to achieve their goals. Thus, give the people of Makati a 
                        lasting legacy, a public library of its own. This dream was fulfilled, but still, 
                        the library had no permanent building it could call its own. Under the 
                        administration of Mayor Jejomar C. Binay, the library was moved to another 
                        building on June 6, 1987, with bigger space and better facilities.<br><br> 
                        The present efforts of the Library staff are geared towards updating the 
                        collection of books and other reading materials to cope with the advancement in 
                        science and modern times and the delivery of better public library services to 
                        the people of Makati.<br><br> Other institutions that were giving continued 
                        support to update the library collections were The Asia Foundation, Inc., Makati 
                        Rotary Club, Thomas Jefferson Library, International School, Makati Jaycees, and 
                        other civic-minded citizens of Makati. Among their donations were books and 
                        audio-visual materials. Another institution is the National Library whose support 
                        is not only in terms of yearly allocation of books but also of supervision in the 
                        efficient management and functioning of the library.<br><br> Shortly, after its 
                        establishment in 1954 until the 1990's, the Makati Municipal Library was under 
                        the Mayor's Office. After the cityhood of Makati in 1995, the library's name was 
                        changed to Makati City Library under the administration of former Mayor Jejomar 
                        C. Binay. The reorganizational structure of the city then placed the Library 
                        under the Education Department as one of its divisions.<br><br> In February 2000, 
                        the Makati City Library was relocated to the 8th Floor of the New City Hall 
                        Building under its new City Librarian, Mrs. Rosario Ibay Amerca. The facilities 
                        were much better with mobile shelves provision, computers with internet service, 
                        new tables, carrels, chairs and an audio-visual room. The ambiance in the new 
                        library is more conducive to serious reading and research. With the support of 
                        the City Government, The National Library, and other stakeholders the City 
                        Library continued to evolve to become a hybrid library.
